	about: {
		title: "Hi! I'm Rowan.",
		description: [
			"I am an aspiring web/software developer and lifelong resident of New York's Hudson Valley.",
			"I have always loved computers, and as a kid I used to play with the MS-DOS command line on an old, internet-incapable IBM PC that was given to my family in the late 90s.",
			"Growing up, money was tight â€” so we were late joining the home computer party, but we got there! I began my journey in earnest by teaching myself how to code about 10 years ago.",
			"I was encouraged by a great long-time friend, a Senior Software Architect, who convinced me of my own potential. I learned just enough C# to be dangerous but wanted to formally learn another object-oriented language I could apply to diverse projects.",
			"JavaScript, with its rich ecosystem and libraries, became my choice. I wanted formal feedback to grow, so in 2022 I enrolled in and successfully completed the full-stack JavaScript (MERN) development program from MIT xPro.",
			"When I am not coding, I enjoy playing video games, roasting coffee, brewing beer, creating unique wines, and sharing all of these with family and friends.",
			"Hobbies aside, I am married to my best friend Nicki, and together we spoil our two beloved cats immensely. :)"
